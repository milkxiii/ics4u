              Our story!
        By: Hamshini and Lynn
     
    Once upon a time, there was a penguin 
named pingu. he had a cool and extravagant 
hat that was full of magic - if the hat 
became hot, then it would crash; if the 
hat became cold, then it would run. despite 
the warm and humid weather, his life was 
great! 

    However, one stormy evening, he went to 
the pond. Pingu's life was ruined! That was 
the most gruelling experience of his life! 
Not only did he fall down, but he also fell 
up. at the pond, he met a duck named dingu. 
dingu was a mean, selfish, and horrible 
duck: he would push pingu around as he shouted, 
"HEY! This is MY territory!" Scared, pingu let 
out a frightened shriek: "AAAAHHHHH!" all his 
life, he never, ever, ever encountered someone 
THIS rude! he wanted to go, but pingu thought
that dingu needed some help. so, pingu stayed 
at the pond for 23 hours before finally yelling, 
"THATS NOT FAIR!!!" dingu was appalled. How DARE 
a PENGUIN say such AUDACIOUS things? all he 
wanted to do was shut him up for good, so he 
pulled out a sharp object and raised his small 
arm. "that is the WORST excuse EVER!!!! you are 
being ILLEGAL," dingu growled. pingu whimpered, 
"waahhhh :( w-what are you going to do with that..." 
(author's note: hey guys, hope you're enjoying the 
story so far. what do you think will happen next?) 
dingu approached him with a sardonic grin, "don't 
worry little child, this won't take too long, if 
you cooperate." silence fell upon the entire pond, 
only broken by pingu's shuddered breathing.

    Pingu's eyes shut tight as he braced for impact. 
Then, his eyes suddenly opened as he let out a sigh 
of relief. He looked up at his ceiling, catching his 
breath. Luckily, it was all a dream.

                   THE END.
          
Little did pingu know, the quiet sound of quacks could 
be heard emanating from the other room...
